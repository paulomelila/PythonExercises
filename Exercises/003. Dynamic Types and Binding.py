# Example of dynamic types and binding in Python

# binding of an integer value to a variable x
x = 5

# prints the current type of the variable
print("Variable type:", type(x))

# binding of a String value to the same variable x
x = "Hello"

# prints the current type of the variable x
print("Variable type:", type(x))
